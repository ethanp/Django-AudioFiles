Keep Note
---------

* You can't (easily) get access to the *microphone* when running `Chrome` locally,
  but you can with `Firefox`, so use that for now.

So Far
------

* Still gotta figure out how to copy the JS from one of the following sites that I found on
  [this StackOv response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16413063/html5-record-audio-to-file):
    * [http://www.danieldemmel.me/JSSoundRecorder/](http://www.danieldemmel.me/JSSoundRecorder/)
        * [https://github.com/daaain/JSSoundRecorder](https://github.com/daaain/JSSoundRecorder)
    * [https://github.com/nusofthq/Recordmp3js](https://github.com/nusofthq/Recordmp3js)
    * [http://nusofthq.com/blog/recording-mp3-using-only-html5-and-javascript-recordmp3-js/](http://nusofthq.com/blog/recording-mp3-using-only-html5-and-javascript-recordmp3-js/)
    * [http://audior.ec/recordmp3js/](http://audior.ec/recordmp3js/)

This [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/)
looks decent too.
