Still Todo
----------

1. Remove the `Form`, I don't be needing it
2. Figure out how to include JS files into Django projects
3. Go to that simplistic JS file for recording an audio file to the browser,
   and implement it in `Conversation`

Keep Note
---------

* You can't (easily) get access to the *microphone* when running `Chrome` locally,
  but you can with `Firefox`, so use that for now.

So Far
------

I got the minimal example working from
[a GitHub project](https://github.com/axelpale/minimal-django-file-upload-example/tree/master/src/for_django_1-6/myproject/myproject/myapp)
I [found on StackOv](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5871730/need-a-minimal-django-file-upload-example).

* Still gotta figure out how to copy the JS from one of the following sites that I found on
  [this StackOv response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16413063/html5-record-audio-to-file):

The intro tutorial to Django 1.6
[is here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/).

This [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/)
looks decent too.
