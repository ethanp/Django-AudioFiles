Where I Left Off
================

When I run `python manage.py runserver` I get a `No module named
myproject.myapp.urls` error. This is the product of a bad copy/paste job from
[a GitHub project](https://github.com/axelpale/minimal-django-file-upload-example/tree/master/src/for_django_1-6/myproject/myproject/myapp) I [found on StackOv](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5871730/need-a-minimal-django-file-upload-example). Instead, the plan is to *actually* copy/paste that project
in here so that I don't have to worry bout that shit no mo.

* I was about to start importing the code from /Users/Ethan/code/personal_project_use/code_to_base_off_of/Python/minimal-django-file-upload-example/src/for_django_1-6 so I can just use that as a starting point
* Then I was going to figure out how to copy the JS from one of the following sites that I found on [this StackOv response](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16413063/html5-record-audio-to-file):
    * [http://www.danieldemmel.me/JSSoundRecorder/](http://www.danieldemmel.me/JSSoundRecorder/)
        * [https://github.com/daaain/JSSoundRecorder](https://github.com/daaain/JSSoundRecorder)
    * [https://github.com/nusofthq/Recordmp3js](https://github.com/nusofthq/Recordmp3js)
    * [http://nusofthq.com/blog/recording-mp3-using-only-html5-and-javascript-recordmp3-js/](http://nusofthq.com/blog/recording-mp3-using-only-html5-and-javascript-recordmp3-js/)

The intro tutorial to Django 1.6 [is here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/).

This [Capturing Audio & Video in HTML5](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/) looks decent too.
